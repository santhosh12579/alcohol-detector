# Alcohol Detection with Engine Lock

We usually come across drink and driving cases where drunk drivers crash their cars under the influence of alcohol causing damage to property 
and life. So here we propose an innovative system to eliminate such cases. Our proposed system would be constantly monitoring the driver breath 
by placing it on the driver wheel or somewhere the driverâ€™s breath can be constantly monitored by it. So, if a driver is drunk and tries to drive,
the system detects alcohol presence in his/her breath and locks the engine so that the vehicle fails to start. The system uses an Arduino, PC fan,
alcohol sensor, and buzzer. The Arduino(microcontroller) on encountering high alcohol signal from the alcohol sensor indicates alcohol detection 
through buzzer and stops the Fan to demonstrate as engine locking. When alcohol is detected after engine starting, the system locks the engine at 
that time. This Project presents an innovative way of protecting automobiles from drunken drivers for safeguarding them. Programming language used
in the Arduino is C++.


# Objective of the Project
Every system is automated in order to face new challenges. In the present days Automated systems have fewer manual operations,flexibility,
reliability and accurate. Due to this demand every field prefers automated control systems. We usually come across drink and driving cases where
drunk drivers crash their cars under the influence of alcohol
causing damage to property and life. So here we propose an innovative system to eliminate such cases. 

Our proposed system would be constantly monitoring the driver breath by placing it on the driver wheel or somewhere the driverâ€™s breath can be constantly 
monitored by it. So, if a driver is drunk and tries to drive the system detects alcohol presence in his/her breathe and locks the engine so that the 
vehicle fails to start. In another case if the driver is not drunk while he starts the vehicle and engine is started but he/she drinks while driving 
the sensor still detects alcohol in his breath and stops the engine so that the car would not accelerate any further and driver can steer it to roadside. 
So, the alcohol sensor is used to monitor uses breath and constantly sends signals to the microcontroller.
